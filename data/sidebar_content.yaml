    description: "My portfolio contains proprietary and confidential information. It shows a sample of my works reflecting five years of marketing, strategy, advertising, and public relations experience. The examples I've selected were built during my time working at a variety of advertising and public relations agencies. All the examples in this file are the sole property of the customer for whom it was made, and it may not be replicated or reproduced in any form. A final note is that marketing is a collaborative activity. Although we have different expertise, my team member put the same effort as me in all those projects. Therefore, I want to thank my team members who put effort into all those projects. "
