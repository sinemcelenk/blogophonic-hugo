D Byers & Associates is an Ohio-based consultancy firm that determines the needs of organizations and creates strategic plans that enable them to reach their goals. The company has a competitive advantage in employer engagement, getting realistic results, building strong relationships, and sales and business development. After making research I've discovered that even though the company offers high-level solutions to its clients they were not well-known in the industry. Moreover, they did not have a sustainable social media marketing plan as well as digital marketing and PR plans.

The main goals of the marketing plan I've created for them are to create brand awareness, improve the company’s social media presence, promote their services, reach and attract potential prospects and establish authority in the industry. I created a detailed marketing plan for D Byers & Associates and shared unique recommendations and examples of five main tasks which are Social Media Brand Guideline, Lead Generation Strategies, Social Media Marketing Strategy, Website & SEO, and Public Relations Ideas. 

As a part of my MBA program, I worked alone in this project and provide D Byers & Associates a marketing consultant service.

In this project, I've conducted market research, created the core marketing strategy, designed all the creative assets including brand guidelines, and created the website design.
