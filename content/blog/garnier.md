### Strategy & Audience

We knew the fact that a person receives more than half of the ultraviolet (UV) in their childhood. (Source: United States Environmental Protection Agency)

We create a strategy that plans to reach thousands of elementary and secondary students in Istanbul and educate them about sun safety. 

An educational play was prepared with a language and content that our target age group can easily understand the concept, and have fun while learning about how to avoid UV Radiation and sun exposure.

Cooperation was made with the Ministry of Education and the theater play was performed in schools across Istanbul. 

A special bag was prepared to be given to all the kids at the end of the play. The bag included an educational brochure and Garnier Ambre Solaire sunscreen.

A launch party was organized with a special concept.

Celebrities, influencer moms, and the press invited the party with their kids.

Press and influencer kit was prepared that includes the product.

Reached over 20,000 elementary school students in 6 months.
