Garnier is a cosmetics brand of French cosmetic company Lâ€™oreal Paris. The company has four product categories: hair color, haircare, skincare, and suncare. They came with the idea of creating awareness about skin cancer, which is a rising health problem all around the world. We decided to generate and execute a corporate social responsibility campaign that reaches the right target group and raises awareness about UV Radiation and sun exposure.

### The Idea 

We know that a person receives more than half of the ultraviolet (UV) in their childhood. (Source: The United States Environmental Protection Agency)

We create a strategy to reach thousands of elementary and secondary students in Istanbul and educate them about sun safety.

An educational play was prepared with a language and content that our target age group could easily understand the concept and have fun while learning how to avoid UV Radiation and sun exposure.

Cooperation was made with the Ministry of Education, and the theater play was performed in schools across Istanbul.

A special kit was prepared to be given to all the kids at the end of the play.

A launch party was organized with a unique concept.

Celebrities, influencer moms, and the press invited the party with their kids.

Concept press and influencer kits were prepared.
