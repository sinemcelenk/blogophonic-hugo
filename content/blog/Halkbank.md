### The Idea

HalkBank  was celebreting its 80th years in the banking industry. The brand team wanted to create a big volume at the same time in Turkey's all of 81 cities. Our main goal was to build a campaign that speaks to emotions and shows Halbank's 80 years of relationship with its clients. The strategy was built to support brand image.
