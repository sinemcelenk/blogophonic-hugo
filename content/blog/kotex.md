Kotex is a feminine hygiene brand of American company Kimberly-Clark Corporation. In 2016, Kotex's research showed that women feel unhappy, tired and uneasy on their special days throughout the year. This mood also affects their entire social life. Therefore, the “60 Special Days” they spend in 365 days are restless days for them. To get attention to this issue and launch the new Kotex we created a PR strategy and organized celebrity management.

### The Idea

The new Kotex was offering women experiencing the feeling of comfort and confidence on their special days and feel comfortable these days as they feel all year. The new Kotex was developed with the aim of eliminating the worries experienced by women who feel uncomfortable and worried on their special days. The main strategy was that Kotex gives back the “60 Special Days”, where women feel unhappy throughout the year.
